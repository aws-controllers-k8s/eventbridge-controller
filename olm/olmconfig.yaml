  **About Amazon EventBridge**


  EventBridge is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for 
  you to build scalable event-driven applications. Use it to route events from sources such as home-grown applications, 
  AWS services, and third- party software to consumer applications across your organization. EventBridge provides a simple
  and consistent way to ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events so you can build new applications quickly.


  **About the AWS Controllers for Kubernetes**
